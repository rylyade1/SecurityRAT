# What is this

**OWASP Security RAT** (Requirement Automation Tool) is a tool supposed to assist with the problem of addressing security requirements during application development. The typical use case is:

- specify parameters of the software artifact you're developing
- based on this information, list of common security requirements is generated
- go through the list of the requirements and choose how you want to handle the requirements
- persist the state in a JIRA ticket (the state gets attached as a YAML file)
- create JIRA tickets for particular requirements in a batch mode in developer queues
- import the main JIRA ticket into the tool anytime in order to see progress of the particular tickets
